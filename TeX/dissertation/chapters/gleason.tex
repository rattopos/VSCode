\section{Gleason's Theorem}

\begin{theorem}
    Let \(H\) be a Hilbert space with \(\dim H \ge 3\). Then any bounded completely additive measure \(\mu\) on the projection lattice \(P(H)\) extends uniquely to a normal functional on the algebra \(B(H)\) of all bounded operators action on \(H\).
\end{theorem}
