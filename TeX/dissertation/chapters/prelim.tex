\section{Elements of Operator Algebras}

Let \(A\) be a \(C^\ast\)-algebra. A \emph{state} in \(C^\ast\)-algebra is a positive functional \(\rho\) which is \(\left \lVert \rho \right \rVert=1\).


\begin{definition}
    A von Neumann algebra is a \(C^\ast\)-algebra that can be faithfully represented as a strongly operator closed \(\ast\)-algebra of \(B(H)\)
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Bicommutant theorem]
    A \(\ast\)-subalgebra \(M\) of \(B(H)\) that contains the unit of \(B(H)\) if \(M\) is a
