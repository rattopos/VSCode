\section{\Require-algebras}

An \emph{involution} on a complex Banach algebra \(A\) is the map \(\ast: A \to A\) such that
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \(\alpha x + \beta y = \bar{\alpha}x^\ast + \bar{b}y^\ast\)
        \item \((xy)^\ast = y^\ast x^\ast \)
        \item \((x^\ast)^\ast = x\)
    \end{enumerate}
whenever \(x,y \in A\) and \(\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{C}\).

A \emph{\(C^\ast\)-algebra} is a complex Banach algebra with an involution that satisfies the additional condition \(\left \lVert x^\ast x \right \rVert = \left \lVert x \right \rVert^2\)

If \(A\) and \(A'\) are Banach algebras with involutions, a mapping \(\varphi: A \to A'\) is called \emph{\(\ast\)-homomorphism} if it is a homomorphism of algebras such that \(\varphi(x^\ast) = \varphi(x)^\ast\)

\section{The Gelfand-Naimark-Segal construction}

Let \(\varphi\) be a positive functional on a \(C^\ast\)-algebra \(A\). Then \(\varphi\) induces a semidefinite inner product \(\left \langle \cdot , \cdot \right \rangle\) on H which is defined by \[\left \langle x,y \right \rangle = \varphi(y^\ast x) \]
for all \(x,y \in H\).

\begin{theorem}
    For any positive functional \(\rho\) on a \(C^\ast\)-algebra \(A\) there is a Hilbert space, \(H_\rho\), a \(\ast\)-homomorphism, \(\pi:A \to B(H_\rho)\), and a cyclic vector, \(\xi_\rho \in H_\rho\), such that
    \[\rho(x) = \left \langle \pi_\rho(x) \xi_\rho,\xi_\rho \right \rangle\]
    Moreover, the triple \((\pi_\rho,H_\rho,\xi_\rho)\) is unique up to a unitary transformation between the corresponding Hilbert spaces.
\end{theorem}
